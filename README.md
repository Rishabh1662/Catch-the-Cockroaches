## Implementation Details

In this project, the "Catch the Cockroaches" website was created using JavaScript and CSS. Here's an overview of how it was implemented:

1. **HTML Structure**: The website's layout was built using HTML elements, such as `div`, `span`, and `button`, to create the required sections and elements of the game.

2. **CSS Styling**: CSS was used to style the website elements, including colors, sizes, fonts, and positions, to create an attractive user interface.

3. **JavaScript Interaction**: The game functionality was implemented using JavaScript. Key JavaScript concepts and features used include:

   - `onclick`: Event listeners were added to the cockroach elements to trigger the `catch` function when the user clicks on them.

   - `setTimeout`: Cockroaches appear on the screen at random intervals using `setTimeout`, and they disappear if not caught within a certain time.

   - Score Counter: The score increases whenever the user successfully catches a cockroach, and it updates on the screen.

   - Timer: A countdown timer was implemented to limit the game duration. The game ends when the timer reaches zero.

   - Cockroach Selection: If applicable, players may be allowed to choose different types of cockroaches to catch.
